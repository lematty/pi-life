# Here is a list of things I usually install on a Raspberry Pi. I'll automate some of these eventually.

## Change default password
The default password for a Raspberry Pi is `raspberry`. Always a good idea to change that right away.
```
passwd
```

## Update and Upgrade packages
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

## Install vim
```
sudo apt install vim
```
