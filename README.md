### Raspberry Pis are awesome. The possibilities are endless. 

<br>
That said, working with Raspberry Pis, many times I end up doing the same thing over and over for some parts of their setup. I don't want exactly the same thing on each pi, so an automation script is out of the question. I usually find some way to do something cool, then a few days later, I couldn't tell you how I did it without looking up all the documentation and commmands again. With that, I decided to start documenting things that I might find useful in the future, and maybe just some projects that I work on. I know it will help me out for reference, but if it can same someone else some time too, even better!
